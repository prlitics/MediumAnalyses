## An analysis of how proximity to a dog track effected the vote on Florida's Amendment 13

This repository contains the code and data I used in my medium article on how precinct proximity to one of the state's greyhound tracks affected vote choice and turnout on Amendment 13, which effectively banned dog racing in the state.

## Language
The analysis was performed in R (3.5.2). The full R code for the analysis and for (most) of the visuals is under `GreyHoundVoting.R`.

## Data
The data needed to replicate the analysis is found under `dogtracks.csv` (which is the gps locations of the state's then-thirteen open tracks) and `VESTFL18StateWide.zip` (which is a shapefile containing precinct level results for all statewide races in Florida's 2018 midterms).
